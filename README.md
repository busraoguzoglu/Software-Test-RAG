# RAG-Based Test Case Generator

This system is designed to showcase the capabilities of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with a small local LLM (Llama.cpp) in generating structured and detailed test cases using design documents and HTML files. 

## Features

### Software Design Document Integration:

Parses software design documents to extract relevant features and functionalities.

### HTML Preprocessing:

Analyzes the HTML structure of the mock website to identify key elements such as buttons, forms, and links.

### RAG-Based Test Case Generation:

Uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation model to create detailed and structured test scenarios.

Supports generating example QA pairs and step-by-step guidance for test cases.
